# 📊 Task 2: Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
## 📝 Task Description

In this task, I worked on cleaning real-world datasets by identifying and handling missing values. The main objective was to improve data quality and make the dataset ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## 📂 Dataset Used

For this task, I used the following datasets which contain real-world missing values:

House Prices (Ames Housing Dataset)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

## 🔍 Work Performed

During this task, I performed the following steps:

Loaded the dataset and identified missing values using .isnull().sum()

Analyzed missing value distribution to understand data quality

Visualized missing data patterns using bar charts

Removed columns with extremely high missing values

Applied median imputation for numerical columns

Applied mode imputation for categorical columns

Validated the dataset after cleaning to ensure missing values were handled

Compared dataset size and quality before and after cleaning

## 📦 Deliverables

A cleaned dataset saved as cleaned_dataset.csv

A Jupyter Notebook containing all data cleaning steps and visualizations

## 🎯 Outcome

After completing the cleaning process, the dataset had significantly fewer missing values and improved consistency. This task helped me gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing and data quality improvement using Python.

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

Through this task, I learned how to:

Handle missing values effectively

Decide when to impute data or remove features

Improve overall data quality for machine learning workflows
